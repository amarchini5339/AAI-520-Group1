##  Project Overview

This project implements an autonomous AI system that performs comprehensive financial analysis on companies and generates investment recommendations. The system coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to conduct multi-source research and synthesize findings into data-driven investment insights.

### Core Components

**RouterMain.py** - Main orchestration engine that coordinates all research agents  
**yahoo_find_ticker.py** - Company identification and ticker resolution service  
**SECresearcher.py** - SEC regulatory filings analysis agent  
**sec_tools.py** - SEC EDGAR API integration and financial calculation tools  
**YahooFinanceCrew.py** - Market data and technical analysis agent  
**FREDresearcher.py** - Economic data analysis agent wrapper  
**fred_tools.py** - FRED API integration and macroeconomic analysis  
**News_Agent_Crew.py** - News sentiment analysis crew wrapper  
**News_Agent.py** -  News research agent with self-reflection  


## ðŸ”„ Workflow Process

### 1. Company Identification
- Input: Company name or ticker symbol
- Process: Resolves to official stock symbol using Yahoo Finance APIs
- Output: Symbol, company details, and security type classification

### 2. Intelligent Routing
- Analyzes security type (Equity vs Non-Equity)
- Routes to appropriate analysis path based on security classification
- Handles unknown security types with error reporting
